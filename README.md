## Project description:

**The goal is to create an application that will assist victims of strokes in repairing their motor functions through various challenges. The team wishes for these challenges to be understandable and for them to be engaging enough to encourage repeated sessions for repairing.**

## Installation: 
  
  To run the exercises, you have three options:
  - Open one of the pre-configured p5js exercise links listed below.
  - Copy the entire contents of an exercise's JavaScript file and paste them into the [p5js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and run them in the web editor.
  - Open the HTML file locally in a browser (this will default to showing you exercise 1 but if you wish to try a seperate exercise, edit line 16 of the `index.html` file and replace it with the filename of whichever exercise you want to use.
